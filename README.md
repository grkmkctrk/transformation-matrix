## transformation-matrix

There are two algorithms forward and backward kinematic.

Forward kinematics find the location of end of the robot arm in global coordinate plane.
In this algorithm givens are length of the robot arms and degree of between robot arms.

Backward kinematics find the degree of between the robot arms for reach the target point.       
In this algorithm givens are length of the robot arms and location of end of the robot arm.
This project is calculate the transformation matrix that you need when you use these algorithms.
